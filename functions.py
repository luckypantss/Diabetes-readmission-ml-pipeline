""""
This module contains different, smaller, functions that are used in the main pipeline. The functions
are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing for easy integration into different parts of the pipeline.
The functions are organized into different categories based on their functionality, such as data cleaning, data transformation,
data analysis, and data visualization. Each function is documented with a docstring that describes its purpose, input parameters, and return values.
The functions are designed to be efficient and optimized for performance, using vectorized operations and avoiding loops where possible.

    Checks the total proportion of placeholder codes in a column.
    Drops rows containing them if total is below threshold.

        placeholder_codes (list): List of codes considered 'missing'.
