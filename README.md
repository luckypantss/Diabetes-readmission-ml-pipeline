# 🧠 Diabetes Readmission Prediction – ML Pipeline Project

This is an individual machine learning project that applies concepts from my university ML course to a real-world healthcare problem. The project is designed to follow a structured ML pipeline and align with course topics such as data preparation, model training, evaluation, and explainability.

### 🔍 Problem Statement
The goal is to predict whether a patient with diabetes will be readmitted to the hospital **within 30 days** of a previous visit. This is framed as a **binary classification** task using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### 🎯 Project Goals
- Apply ML pipeline concepts in a practical, end-to-end setting
- Explore model performance and interpretability in a healthcare context
- Reflect the structure and topics covered in my course lectures (e.g., data preprocessing, neural networks, explainability, etc.)

### 📦 Current Scope
We are currently in the **data preparation & feature engineering phase**, including:
- Cleaning and normalizing raw data
- Handling ambiguous and missing values
- Dropping irrelevant or redundant features
- Identifying feature types (categorical vs numerical)
- Applying context-aware imputation strategies

### ✅ Completed So Far
- Placeholder value replacement (`?`, `NA`, etc. → `np.nan`)
- EDA-informed feature dropping (low variance, high missingness, no signal)
- Feature type separation and reclassification of code-like features
- Smart imputation logic (based on distribution and missingness thresholds)
- Validation checks for coverage and feature integrity

_Upcoming steps: feature encoding, scaling, pipeline construction, model training, evaluation, and explainability._

🚀 Built for learning, built with intent.
